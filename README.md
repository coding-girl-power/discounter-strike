# Discounter Strike

Discounter Strike is a work in progress game.

For now, this is just a boilerplate that uses [Phaser](https://phaser.io) without any tooling.

For local development you need a local webserver.
(e.g. [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb))

You find the latest development version running on <https://coding-girl-power.github.io/discounter-strike/>
